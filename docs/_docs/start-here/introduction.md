Codenvy makes on-demand workspaces to give you a better agile experience. Codenvy SaaS is available for self-service at codenvy.com. You can also install Codenvy on your own infrastructure with Codenvy On-Prem.
# Codenvy and Eclipse Che  
Codenvy is a commercial offering based on the [Eclipse Che](https://eclipse.org/che/) open source project, so Eclipse Che workspaces and plug-ins will work within Codenvy.

Codenvy has added enterprise features to Eclipse Che including:
* Workspace distribution across an elastic cluster with an embedded Docker Swarm
* Operational solutions for monitoring, scaling, upgrading and archiving workspaces
* Team management, permissions and resource policy management tools
* User authentication, single-sign on, and LDAP
* Self-service user registration
* Factories - which add actions and a simple URL execution option to the portable workspaces of Eclipse Che
