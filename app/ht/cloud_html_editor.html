	<hr class="subtitle-line">

	<p>Codenvy addresses multiple needs in the end-to-end cloud development
	workflow.  But developers virtually "live" in the editor/IDE, so having
	a complete and powerful Cloud HTML and CSS Editor (in addition to multiple other web languages) is essential to project success.
	</p>
	<p>The Codenvy Cloud HTML Editor knows HTML and CSS syntax, formatting and language
		nuances.  The Cloud HTML IDE supports frameworks from multiple Platform as a Service (PaaS) vendors, and we are adding more PaaS support continuously.
		
		Our complete HTML/CSS IDE revolutionize technical workbenches by leveraging cloud’s collaborative, shared, and elastic attributes to make developers more productive.  We strive for simplicity, efficiency and productivity.
	</p>
	<p>In fact, the Codenvy Cloud IDE is so powerful that the Codenvy team uses it
	for all our own in-house development.  i.e, Codenvy is written using the Codenvy IDE.
